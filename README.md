Nothing too useful here. Not for the faint of heart also.

These are my extremely convoluted notes towards a reimplementation of the Tiny Pascal compiler featured on the Byte magazine articles from Sept-Okt-Nov. 1978.

There's only inconsistent, non-sensical pseudo-code here. Seriously, this is just for myself ;-)
